Your task is to figure out why `codeup` aicommits feature is not working.

## FINDINGS - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

### Investigation Completed:
✅ Designed and implemented comprehensive unit test for aicommits functionality
✅ Created test that sets up git repo with realistic changes (README.md, demo.py, utils.py)
✅ Tested AI commit generation directly via `_generate_ai_commit_message()`

### Root Cause Identified:

**The codeup aicommits feature is failing due to incorrect API configurations:**

1. **OpenAI API Issue**: The OpenAI key is present but the git-ai-commit library is routing requests to `dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com` instead of the proper OpenAI API endpoint. This suggests:
   - The git-ai-commit library may be misconfigured
   - The OpenAI client configuration is pointing to the wrong base URL
   - Possibly a version compatibility issue with the openai library

2. **Anthropic API Issue**: The Anthropic key stored in config is a dummy test key (`sk-ant-config-test`) that returns 401 authentication errors.

### Technical Evidence:
```
2025-09-15 13:29:25,089 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"
2025-09-15 13:29:25,090 - zcmds.cmds.common.codeup - WARNING - OpenAI commit message generation failed: OPENAI error: UNKNOWN_ERROR
```

### Next Steps Required:
1. **Fix OpenAI Configuration**: Investigate why git-ai-commit is using wrong API endpoint
2. **Set Valid Anthropic Key**: Replace dummy key with valid Anthropic API key
3. **Test Both Fallback Paths**: Ensure both OpenAI and Anthropic workflows function correctly

### Unit Test Status:
- ✅ Test framework implemented and working
- ✅ Test environment setup (temp git repos, staged changes)
- ✅ API call integration verified
- ❌ Both API providers failing due to configuration issues
- ❌ Actual commit message generation failing

**The codeup aicommits feature has correct implementation logic but fails due to API configuration problems, not code bugs.**
